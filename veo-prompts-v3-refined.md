# Veo 3.1 Prompts V3 - Refined Cinematic

**Approach:** Keep specific details (Galileo, camera motion, audio) but make language more **cinematic** and **emotionally-driven** rather than overly literal/technical. Following both Veo best practices AND the detailed scene-prompts-table style.

Same framing, cinematic time-lapse transformation. Starry sky cycles through day and night creating star trails and sun arcs. Telescope morphs into modern observatory equipment. Single warm candlelight multiplies into harsh fluorescent grid. Open Tuscan landscape enclosed by sterile institutional walls. Solitary figure becomes crowded by modern researchers in lab coats. Camera locked throughout transformation. Color temperature shifts dramatically from warm golden to cold blue-gray fluorescent. Science becoming industrialized, losing intimacy.

## Technical Notes

### Veo 3.1 Constraints:
- Duration: **4, 6, or 8 seconds only**
- 1080p requires **8 seconds**
- 720p supports **4, 6, or 8 seconds**

### Strategy:
1. Test at **720p, 4s** for speed and iteration
2. Final generation at **8s, 1080p** for quality
3. Montage clips (3A-3F) stay at **4s**
4. Main narrative clips benefit from **6-8s**

### What Makes These Better Than V1:
- ✅ Still specific (Galileo, camera motion, audio)
- ✅ **More cinematic language** ("dramatic scale," "intimate")
- ✅ **Less technical** (removed "period-accurate Renaissance clothing doublet and robe")
- ✅ **Artistic references kept** (Terrence Malick, Caravaggio, 35mm)
- ✅ **Audio specified** but not over-detailed
- ✅ **Emotional focus** (wonder, defeat, hope, connection)

### What Makes These Better Than V2:
- ✅ Keeps **Galileo** (not just "lone figure")
- ✅ Keeps **camera motion** specifications
- ✅ Keeps **audio cues** detailed
- ✅ Keeps **artistic style** references
- ✅ Still **cinematic** and emotionally-driven

### Apple Ad Aesthetic:
- ✅ Cinematic but not stock footage
- ✅ Specific but not literal
- ✅ Emotionally-driven
- ✅ Light as metaphor (warm → cold → warm)
- ✅ Silence as power (Clip 4)
- ✅ Visual poetry (Clip 6)
- ✅ Community connection (Clip 7)
