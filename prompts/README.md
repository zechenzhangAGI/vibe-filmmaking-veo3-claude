# Prompt Evolution

This directory contains all 5 versions of prompts showing the evolution from photorealistic to artistic pencil sketch style.

## Directory Structure

- **v1-initial/** - First attempt: detailed, photorealistic, overly prescriptive
- **v2-cinematic/** - Simplified Apple-style, mood-focused
- **v3-refined/** - Balanced specificity and artistic freedom
- **v4-animated/** - Explored animated styles (paper cut-out, watercolor, etc.)
- **v5-final-pencil/** ✅ - Final production: pencil sketch animation with motion

## Which Version To Use?

**For generating new videos:** Use **v5-final-pencil/** prompts as your starting point.

**For learning:** Compare v1 → v5 to see how prompts evolved from literal to artistic.

## Key Evolution

```
V1: "Galileo Galilei stands at a brass telescope gazing upward at infinite starry night sky in 1610 Tuscany. Wide cinematic establishing shot emphasizing dramatic scale..."
→ Too literal, overly detailed

V2: "Cinematic wide shot of a lone figure at telescope under infinite starry sky. Dramatic scale - vast cosmos above, single silhouette below..."
→ Better mood, still photorealistic

V5: "Subject: Galileo figure at telescope under starry night sky
     Action: Looking through telescope eyepiece, then slowly lifting head upward to gaze at stars with wonder
     Style: Pencil sketch animation, hand-drawn loose gestural lines, charcoal shading..."
→ Perfect! Structured, artistic, with motion
```

## Learnings

1. **Less is more** - Simpler prompts allow better artistic interpretation
2. **Animation > Photorealism** - Animated styles feel more manifesto-appropriate
3. **Structured format** - Subject → Action → Style → Camera → Ambiance → Audio
4. **Pencil sketch wins** - Humanistic, hand-crafted, authentic aesthetic
