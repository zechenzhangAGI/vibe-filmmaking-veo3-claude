# Veo 3.1 Prompts V4 - Animated/Illustrated Style

**Key Change:** Using **animated styles** (paper cut-out, pencil sketch, watercolor) instead of photorealistic. More artistic, better taste, Apple-ad aesthetic.

**Following Veo Best Practices:**
- Subject → Action → Style → Camera → Composition → Focus → Ambiance → Audio

## Technical Notes

### Why Animation Works Better:
1. ✅ **More artistic** - hand-crafted aesthetic vs stock footage feel
2. ✅ **Apple-ad style** - Think "Think Different" illustrations
3. ✅ **Better taste** - Less literal, more metaphorical
4. ✅ **Consistent style** - Animation maintains coherence
5. ✅ **Emotional clarity** - Illustrated emotions read clearly
6. ✅ **Timeless** - Won't look dated like realistic CGI

### Veo Prompt Structure Followed:
- ✅ **Subject** - What/who clearly defined
- ✅ **Action** - Specific movements described
- ✅ **Style** - Animation type specified
- ✅ **Camera** - Position and movement
- ✅ **Composition** - Framing specified
- ✅ **Focus** - Depth of field noted
- ✅ **Ambiance** - Lighting and mood
- ✅ **Audio** - Sound cues included

### Generation Strategy:
1. Test **Clip 1** (paper cut-out) first
2. Test **Clip 4** (pencil sketch) for contrast
3. Test **Clip 6** (abstract illustration) for style variety
4. If approved, generate all clips
5. Use **4s at 720p** for testing speed
6. Use **8s at 1080p** for final quality
