## CLIP 1: Galileo's Wonder (0-5s)

**Type:** Independent
**Duration:** 4s (720p) or 8s (1080p)
**Style:** Cinematic, contemplative, Terrence Malick aesthetic

### Veo Prompt:
```
Cinematic wide shot of a lone figure at telescope under infinite starry sky. Dramatic scale - vast cosmos above, single silhouette below. Warm golden light from window contrasts with cool blue starlight. Face tilted upward in pure wonder. Intimate and contemplative. Shot on 35mm film, warm color grading. Shallow depth of field. Gentle night wind, breath of awe. Soft music.
```

**Rationale:** Removed period-specific details, let Veo interpret "lone figure" artistically. Focus on **mood** (wonder, intimacy) and **cinematic language** (dramatic scale, contrast).

## CLIP 2: Time Collapse (5-10s)

**Type:** Extend from Clip 1
**Duration:** 8s
**Style:** Abstract temporal transition

### Veo Prompt:
```
Same framing transforms through time. Starry sky morphs into fluorescent ceiling. Single figure becomes crowded by many. Warm candlelight becomes harsh cold lights. Open space closes into institutional walls. Camera locked, showing transformation. Warm golden to cold blue color shift. Surreal time-lapse. Ethereal sound design, organic becoming mechanical.
```

**Rationale:** Simplified transformation, focus on **contrast** (warm→cold, one→many, open→closed). Let visual poetry speak.

**Type:** Extend from Clip 4
**Duration:** 4s

### Veo Prompt:

Warm strings swelling emotionally but restrained. Collective breathing. Sense of community. Cinematic wide shot.
```

**Rationale:** **Visual metaphor** of constellation = movement. Focus on **warm lights in darkness** and **community feeling**.

## Generation Notes

### Duration Constraints (Veo 3.1):
- **4, 6, or 8 seconds** only
- **1080p requires 8 seconds**
- **720p supports 4, 6, or 8 seconds**

### Recommended Approach:
1. **Test at 720p, 4s** first for speed
2. If quality good, generate **final at 8s, 1080p**
3. Montage clips (3A-3F) can stay at 4s
4. Main narrative clips benefit from 8s

- ✅ **Silence and restraint** - not bombastic
- ✅ **Visual poetry** - abstract, metaphorical

### Color Journey:
- Warm golden (past, curiosity)
- Cold blue (present, systems)
- Warm amber (future, hope)
